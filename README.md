# Pokeball Factories and Childhood Asthma: Research Analysis Plan

## Research Question
**Primary Objective**: Determine the causal effect of Pokeball factory openings on childhood asthma incidence in affected towns.

## Data Overview

### Available Datasets
1. **Hospital Data** (16-year balanced panel, 2000-2015)
   - `hospital`: Hospital name (includes city information)
   - `cases<y>`: Annual pediatric asthma hospitalizations by year

2. **City Data** (16-year balanced panel, 2000-2015)
   - `city`: City name
   - `population`: 2010 Census population
   - `lawchange`: Binary indicator for subsidy eligibility
   - `factory_<y>`: Number of Pokeball factories by year
   - `production_<y>`: Annual Pokeball production volume by year

### Key Identifying Variation
- **Natural Experiment**: 2007 law providing subsidies for Pokeball factory openings
- **Assumption**: Law passage was random and unexpected (exogenous shock)

## Analytical Strategy

### 1. Data Preparation and Exploration
- **Merge datasets** using city identifiers extracted from hospital names
- **Construct outcome variable**: Asthma cases per capita (cases/population)
- **Create time indicators**: Pre-law (2000-2006) vs. Post-law (2007-2015)
- **Generate treatment variables**: Factory presence, production levels, timing of openings

### 2. Descriptive Analysis
- **Temporal trends** in asthma rates by treatment status
- **Geographic distribution** of subsidized vs. non-subsidized cities
- **Factory establishment patterns** post-2007
- **Summary statistics** across treatment and control groups

### 3. Causal Identification Strategy

#### Primary Approach: Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
**Treatment Groups:**
- Treatment: Cities that received subsidies (`lawchange = 1`)
- Control: Cities that did not receive subsidies (`lawchange = 0`)

**Model Specification:**
```
AsthmaRate_it = β₀ + β₁(Post2007_t) + β₂(Subsidized_i) + β₃(Post2007_t × Subsidized_i) + γX_it + α_i + ε_it
```

Where:
- β₃ = Difference-in-differences estimator (main coefficient of interest)
- α_i = City fixed effects
- X_it = Time-varying controls (population, etc.)

#### Alternative Specifications:
1. **Event Study Design**: Examine dynamic treatment effects by years since factory opening
2. **Intensity Treatment**: Use factory count or production volume as continuous treatment
3. **Staggered DiD**: Account for variation in factory opening timing

### 4. Robustness Checks
- **Parallel trends assumption**: Pre-2007 trend analysis
- **Placebo tests**: False treatment timing
- **Alternative outcome definitions**: Raw case counts, age-adjusted rates
- **Sample restrictions**: Urban vs. rural, population thresholds
- **Clustering**: Standard errors at city/state level

## Key Assumptions

### Critical for Causal Inference:
1. **Exogenous policy shock**: 2007 law passage was unexpected and quasi-random
2. **Parallel trends**: Treatment and control cities would have similar asthma trends absent treatment
3. **SUTVA**: No spillover effects between cities
4. **No anticipation effects**: Cities didn't change behavior before factory openings

### Data Assumptions:
1. Hospital data captures representative sample of pediatric asthma cases
2. City-hospital matching is accurate
3. Population denominators are appropriate for rate calculations

## Expected Limitations

### Data Constraints:
- **No individual-level controls**: Age, socioeconomic status, comorbidities
- **Limited geographic controls**: Distance to other pollution sources, climate
- **Potential measurement error**: Hospital catchment areas may cross city boundaries
- **Missing confounders**: Economic development, healthcare access changes

### Methodological Limitations:
- **Selection bias**: If subsidies targeted specific city types
- **Spillover effects**: Neighboring cities might be affected
- **General equilibrium effects**: Industry-wide changes post-2007

## Suggested Additional Data Sources

### For Enhanced Analysis:
1. **Individual patient records**: Demographics, severity, comorbidities
2. **Air quality monitoring**: PM2.5, ozone, industrial emissions data
3. **Economic indicators**: Employment, income, healthcare infrastructure
4. **Geographic data**: Distance to factories, wind patterns, population density
5. **Policy details**: Exact timing, eligibility criteria, factory regulations

### Comparable Studies from Other Countries:
- US EPA air quality and health outcome linkages
- European industrial pollution and respiratory health studies
- China's industrial development and pediatric health research

## Deliverables

### Final Output:
1. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Main DiD results with confidence intervals
   - Robustness checks and sensitivity analysis
   - Event study plots showing dynamic effects

2. **Research Brief** (2-3 pages):
   - Clear statement of findings
   - Discussion of economic and policy significance
   - Limitations and caveats
   - Recommendations for future research

### Key Research Questions to Address:
- What is the magnitude of the factory effect on asthma rates?
- How quickly do health effects manifest after factory openings?
- Do effects vary by factory size/production intensity?
- Are there heterogeneous effects across city characteristics?
